# Music DApp

This project was built to enable decentralized streaming, buying, and reselling of songs using blockchain technology. The app is powered by React for the frontend and Hardhat for managing smart contracts.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npx hardhat clean`

Cleans the build artifacts from previous compilations, ensuring a fresh start.

### `npx hardhat compile`

Compiles the smart contracts to generate necessary artifacts for deployment and interaction.

### `npx hardhat node`

Starts a local blockchain for testing, providing accounts and private keys to simulate a blockchain environment.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the smart contracts to the local blockchain started by `npx hardhat node`.  
Make sure to run this in a new terminal.

### `npm start`

Runs the React app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
